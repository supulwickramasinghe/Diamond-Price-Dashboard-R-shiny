# Diamond-Price-Dashboard-R-shiny
An interactive R Shiny dashboard for exploring and analyzing diamond prices based on key physical and quality attributes. This application enables dynamic filtering, visualization, and statistical insights into how different features influence diamond pricing.

📊 Dataset Variables

The dashboard analyzes diamond prices using the following features:

carat – Weight of the diamond

cut – Quality of the cut (e.g., Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal)

color – Diamond color grade (D–J)

clarity – Clarity grade (e.g., IF, VVS1, VVS2, VS1, VS2, SI1, SI2)

depth – Total depth percentage

table – Width of the top facet relative to the widest point

x – Length (mm)

y – Width (mm)

z – Depth (mm)

price – Price in USD

🚀 Features

Interactive filters for cut, color, clarity, and carat range

Dynamic visualizations (price distribution, carat vs price trends, etc.)

Summary statistics and exploratory data analysis

Responsive UI built with R Shiny

Data visualization using ggplot2

📈 Objective

The goal of this project is to:

Understand how physical characteristics and quality grades impact diamond prices

Provide an intuitive interface for exploratory data analysis

Demonstrate practical application of R Shiny for business analytics
